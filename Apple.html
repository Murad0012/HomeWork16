        <p>Steven Paul Jobs[1] (born February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.  </p>       

        <p style = "padding-left: 20px;">
            Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother.<br>
            He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.<br>
            In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. </p>
